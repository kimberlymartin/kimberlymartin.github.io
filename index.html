		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>My game is a simple brick breaker style game where the player's goal is to destroy all of the bricks. 
		The player controls the platform on the bottom by using the 'A' and 'D' keys to move left and right respectively. 
		Using the platform to bounce the ball, the player must destroy every brick without letting the ball fall past the platform.</p>
		<br />
		
		<h3>Reflection</h3>
		<p> I think I did well working past adversities in this project, however I wish I spent more time on the design and added more functions. 
		I didn't have enough time to implement multiple lives or power ups. 
		Ideally, the game would have a more interactive base or a level system, but I'm very proud of what I accomplished nonetheless.</p>

		<p>This specific set of code controls the collision detection for the bricks. 
		This function finds any item whose coordinates overlap the ball's. 
		I used this to simplify the code by using one function rather than 34 if-statements, one for each brick.
		I then used the coordinates of the ball and the brick that it collided with to determine whether the ball hit on the side of the ball or the top/bottom.
		Depending on where it hit, the ball will change direction and continue moving. Finally, the score increases by 5 points and the brick is deleted.</p>
