		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>Our game is a simple brick breaker style game where the player's goal is to destroy all of the bricks. 
		The player controls the platform on the bottom by using the 'A' and 'D' keys to move left and right respectively. 
		Using the platform to bounce the ball, the player must destroy every brick without letting the ball fall past the platform.</p>
		<br />
		
		<h3>Reflection</h3>
		<p> Personally, I think the game turned out pretty well with all the basic functions we had planned, 
		but I wish we had more time to add extra functionalities such as power-ups. The hardest part of making 
		this app was programming the blocks to move with two second increments between each other. Since the MIT 
		App Inventor doesn't have a 'wait' function, we couldn't easily program the blocks within a loop. We ended 
		up having to use five separate clocks, one for each block, to time the start of their movement. </p>

		<p>This screenshot shows the game after it has begun, with the player avoiding the incoming platforms above them. 
		The score is displayed underneath the player and the platforms are moving downwards at varying speeds.</p>

		<p>This specific set of code controls the player's movement. 
		Every 10 milliseconds the program checks the orientation of the tablet and uses that information to move the player side to side accordingly. 
		This required a lot of guessing variables and numbers to multiply and checking how that affected the movement.</p>
